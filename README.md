### JUNE 07, 2022: What they call baby steps?
--- 
On this day, after weeks of preparation, I passed my AZ-900 exam and got my first ever cloud certificate, **The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**. 

## JUNE 09, 2022: First Project
---
Having passed the AZ-900, I basically googled projects that I could build (to make the theories and azure services that I had studied for the exam) stick. I came across the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and hopefully by the time you read this, you should be able to see that I've completed the challenge in this repo right here on my account and you should check it for more details on this.

As part of the preparation for the AZ-900, I learnt about other ways of without necessarily accessing the azure portal. One way is to use the Azure Cloud Shell, or to locally install the Azure CLI or Powershell on your computer. I had never really gone deep into this when preparing because I didn't have to but today I took upon myself to. I realized alot of cloud admins and other related occupations interact with cloud without really using the UI.

I installed the CLI on my system and having a little expereince with bash helped me with the learning curve when reading the CLI documentation. After reading the documentation, I performed the following actions using the CLI:

- I logged into my azure account

- I created a resource group called "myclirg" in "eastus"

- I created a lock for the "myclirg" resource group of type "cannot delete" named "deleteprooflock". A lock helps to foolproof the safety of a resource scope. This is to prevent users from either accidentally deleting the resource group (delete lock) or accidentally performing any other action asides being able to view resources in the resource group (read-only lock)

- Fully knowing that I had created a delete lock for the resource group, I tried to delete the resource group to see it's powers

The lock worked, Mission failed successfully ðŸ‘Œ

- I deleted the resource group lock and then deleted the resource group.

For the next couple of days I hope to continue to avoid interact with azure using the portal but instead with the cli and cloud shell.

Another way of interacting with Azure is using the cloud shell, this time I wanted to feel a bit more powerful lol and use the cloud shell on my phone. The azure mobile app offers a pocket size azure experience, It lets you monitor your resources, see metrics on those services and even receive push notifications like service health alerts. In addition to this one can use the app to manage resources using the azure cloud shell. I decided to do so but instead create a vm using this
