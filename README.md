### JUNE 07, 2022: What they call baby steps?
--- 
On this day, after weeks of preparation, I passed my AZ-900 exam and got my first ever cloud certificate, **The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**. 

## JUNE 09, 2022: FIRST PROJECT
---
Having passed the AZ-900, I basically googled projects that I could build (to make the theories and azure services that I had studied for the exam) stick. I came across the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and hopefully by the time you read this, you should be able to see the repo right here on my account for more details.
